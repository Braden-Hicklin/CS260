# Hashtables in C++
# View Hashtable.jpg for diagram
## Purpose 
The purpose of this code is to show the usage of hashtables and their respective functions. First I will create a simple hashtable that resolves collision by overwriting
the old value with a new value. Then I will create an improved hashtable that incoorporates a more complex hashfunction to avoid collision that uses chaining.

## Implementation
I will use a hashtable with 10 hashgroups to start, I will use a list and pair that stores an int, and a string. The hashfunction will take an int and return an int. The insertion function will take an int and a string and return nothing. The the remove function will take an int and return nothing. The search function will take an int and return a string. Lastly, the print function will just print the hashtable.

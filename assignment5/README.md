# Auto-Sorting List Operations
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to show proficiency in and explore the various auto sorting functions and operations that can be 
performed using array-based lists and/or linked-lists. This code will be able to take inputs from the user and insert them in a
predefined order, and search for elements within the list.
## Code
The program is an adaptation of the previous assignment4 linked list. I have modified it based on some stuff we learned in class regarding linked list operations. 
The main modifications are found in the auto_sort.cpp file that now includes a seperate Auto_Sort class that contains the functions used for the auto sorting, display, 
position ref, and deletion operations. 
## Assignment Satifaction
tests.cpp contains tests that check each function found in auto_sort.cpp
auto_sort.cpp has a linked list at line 5-8
auto_sort.cpp has an add/sort function found in the Auto_Sort class in at lines 48-64
auto_sort.cpp has a search function using a precise search found at lines 28-40 and performed via the function pull_id at lines 78-101
I have not created a chart that compares algorithmic complexity of my insert, remove, or search functions. (February 13th Email was sent to Joseph regarding the issue as well as a request to meet with him to improve understanding of big O notation.

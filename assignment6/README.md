# Binary Search Tree Assignment
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to show proficency with the usage of binary search trees and their respective functions. 
## Functions
There are four main functions in this program: Insert, Successor, Search, and Print
  Insert: Inserts a new data point into the doubly linked list
  Successor: Deletes data point and finds appropriate replacement node
  Search: Searches through list for specific data point
  Print: Prints list using inorder traversal method
There are two subfunctions in the program: createNode, and minData
  createNode: Private function that dynamically creates new node using new operator (malloc)
  minData: Returns the minimum value found in the tree
## Reflection
I was surprised to learn that this method of dynamic allocation of memory and functions associated with it is something that I am already quite familiar with and have
done in multiple projects in previous courses. For example, in 133c I used a binary search tree to dynamically create, insert, delete, and modify two doubly linked lists
that simulated a schools database for students including ID's, Names, and Grade. After realizing this the project became much easier and I was able to complete the 
assignment with little to no issues. The only real issue I ran into was trying to understand the difference between a basic deletion function and a successor function. 
After some research and rewatching some of the class lectures I realized I was just thinking too linearly and not in a way that fits binary search trees memory layout.

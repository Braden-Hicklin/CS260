# Auto-Sorting List Operations
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to show proficiency in and explore the various auto sorting functions and operations that can be 
performed using array-based lists and/or linked-lists. This code will be able to take inputs from the user and insert them in a
predefined order, and search for elements within the list.
## Code
The program is an adaptation of the previous assignment4 linked list. I have modified it based on some stuff we learned in class regarding linked list operations. The
insertion function has been removed and the addID function has been reworked to create, add, and sort the element. All functions have been cleaned up and reworked to
improve code decompostion and readability.
## Assignment Satifaction
tests.cpp contains tests that check each function found in auto_sort.cpp
auto_sort.cpp has a linked list at line 5-8
auto_sort.cpp has an add/sort function found in the Auto_Sort class in at lines 48-64
auto_sort.cpp has a search function using a precise search found at lines 28-40 and performed via the function pull_id at lines 78-101
I have not created a chart that compares algorithmic complexity of my insert, remove, or search functions. (February 13th Email was sent to Joseph regarding the issue as well as a request to meet with him to improve understanding of big O notation.

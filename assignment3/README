The purpose of this assignment was to create a linked list/queue that included dequeue and enqueue methods, additionally I added an optional method that prints out 
the entire list rather than just the front or rear. 

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
I had dealt with an issue in the past when taking CS 133c where I was struggling to create certain methods that would interact with structs, I was able
to solve this by implementing the methods into the structs themselves. Additionally I had to retweak how I went about inserting components into the queue 
because previously I had made a method that only inserted items into the front of the queue rather than either ends, after some research and looking at old code
I was able to find a solution.

TESTS:
I tested the code using an empty list which print out the expected text indicating that the list was empty.
I tested inserting multiple items into the queue and printing them out, the outcome was as expected.
I tested inserting multiple items into the queue, printing them out, deleting them, and then reprinting the queue; this led to the expected outcome.

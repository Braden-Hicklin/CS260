# Auto-Sorting List Operations
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to show proficiency in and explore the various auto sorting functions and operations that can be 
performed using array-based lists and/or linked-lists. This code will be able to take inputs from the user and insert them in a
predefined order, and search for elements within the list.
## Code
The program is an adaptation of the previous assignment4 linked list. I have modified it based on some stuff we learned in class regarding linked list operations. 
The main modifications are found in the auto_sort.cpp file that now includes a seperate Auto_Sort class that contains the functions used for the auto sorting, display, 
position ref, and deletion operations.

# NOTICE
if this notice is present then that means the project is still incomplete

# Purpose
This project is intended to show some of the functions, features, and algorithms associated with graphs in c++. This a resubmission of the original project as the original
used code that was not owned by me and simply adjusted a few variables and functions. All of the code in this project has been written by me and was created solely for this
project, however there will be some components that are adapted from other peoples design/code (primarily code that was worked on in class). All references and resources will be listed in the Resources tab at the bottom of this readme.

## Implementation

## Tests
### addVertex
add duplicate vertices
add non duplicate vertex

### addEdge
add duplicate edge
add non duplicate edge
add edge with non existent vertices

### edgeExists
check for existing edge
check for non existing edge

### vertexExists
check for existing vertex
check for non existing vertex

### shortestPath


### minSpanTree

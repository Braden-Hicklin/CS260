# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show the some application and usage of graph algorithms. The project uses two different algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest
path, and Prim's algorithm for the minimum spanning tree. The Dijkstra's class uses an adjacency list, and Prim's uses an adjacency matrix, both are initialized in main.

# Implementation
Currently the code is in a first draft state and incomplete, I will be modifying the two programs heavily in the coming days, but for now this is here for submission sake.

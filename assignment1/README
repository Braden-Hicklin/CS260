How a program could model a bag of marbles
1. Define a marble/Create Marble class
  - Color
  - Pattern
  - Size
  
2. Store the marbles in a bag
  - Store/list them using a dictionary so they can be called 
  - Allow dynamic allocation 
  - Allow user to put new marbles into the bag
    - "menu" loop that allows user to choose if they want to create/store a new marble, search for a marble in the bag, or quit

3. TESTS
  - What does the program do when the incorrect variable is entered for color, pattern, size, and menu choice
  - What if you search for a marble that doesn't exist
  - What if you put a marble in with identical components to a marble that already exists


POST PROGRAM COMPLETION
1. Unfortunately I was unable to get the program to work properly, using my initial plan. I wanted to create a struct for the marble bag that would store newly
created marbles. However, I was unable to find a way to effectively dynamically create a class object and insert it into the struct. I'm certain there is an easier way
of doing this, I just wanted to utilize classes and structs to refamiliarize myself with them.
